## Production Deployment

### 1. Replace Test Keys

1. In Stripe Dashboard, toggle to **Live** mode
2. Get live API keys (they start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)
3. Update environment variables in production

### 2. Configure Webhooks for Production

1. Add production webhook endpoint
2. Use your production domain: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/webhook`
3. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with live webhook secret

### 3. Currency Configuration

The system is configured for **Moroccan Dirham (MAD)**. Stripe supports MAD for:

- Card payments
- Bank transfers (in Morocco)
- Mobile wallets

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Payment Tracking

- All payments are tracked in Stripe Dashboard
- Payment history available per athlete
- Insurance status automatically calculated
- PDF receipts generated for each payment

### Key Metrics

- **Annual Revenue**: Total insurance payments collected
- **Active Policies**: Number of athletes with valid insurance
- **Expiring Soon**: Athletes whose insurance expires in 30 days
- **Payment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful payments

## Security Features

âœ… **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles all card data securely  
âœ… **SSL Encryption**: All communications encrypted  
âœ… **Webhook Verification**: Signatures verified for all webhooks

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **Webhook Not Working**: Verify webhook URL and secret
3. **Currency Issues**: Ensure MAD is enabled in Stripe account
4. **Session Expired**: Users have 30 minutes to complete payment

### Logs

Check the following for debugging:
